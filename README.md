**🍎 Food Quality Analysis System using Image Processing & Machine Learning**

**📋 Project Overview**
The integration of an automated food quality analysis system, aimed at revolutionizing the traditional food inspection process and reducing food waste through AI-powered technology. Traditional methods of assessing food quality largely depend on human inspection, which is often subjective, time-consuming, and prone to inconsistency. This project seeks to overcome these limitations by creating an intelligent system that automatically evaluates the freshness and safety of fruits and vegetables in real-time.

**🎯 About the Project**
AI-Powered Food Quality Analyzer is a comprehensive system designed to integrate computer vision and machine learning techniques for automated food freshness assessment. The system leverages advanced image processing algorithms and machine learning models to analyze visual indicators of food spoilage, providing an efficient, objective, and scalable solution for food quality control in both industrial and consumer settings.
